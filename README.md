### this repository is for to understanding the basics of one of the three paradigms of the machine learning called Reinforcement Learning. in this repository i tried to implement the basics of the Reinforcement Learning using the opneai GYM library.  let's understand how Reinforcement learning works. there are basic terminology you need to undestand it.

**-----> Key Terminology <-----**
**Agent: the Agent is one who is interacting in the environment.**

**State(observation): the State is what agent is percieving in the simulation or environment**

**Reward: Reward is the scalar number given to the agent after the taking action in the State, which define how  much that action is fruitfull and good**

**Policy: Policy is the stratagy used by the agent to take actions which could be Stochastic(random) in other words trial and error and Deterministic**

**the Aim of the Agent to increase cumulaticve reward at the end of the all epochs.**
